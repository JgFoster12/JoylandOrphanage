                  A SHELTER IN THE STORM - ISAIAH 4:6 <br>
        
        
        
                  JOYLAND ORPHANAGE is a non-profit ministry, which I, Pastor Dalmas Omwega,and (Esther Michael) from USA started almost 2 years ago. The Lord showed me that I was to help the little children who had no home, and He gave me the name for our Ministry.  We saw a need to help the children who had been abandoned, and myself, along with members of our small church family, take care of these little ones. We care for 35 children ranging in ages from 4 to 12 years old. Due to unforeseen circumstances, they were left all alone, and I felt the Lord calling me to take care of as many children as He sends us. We educate them, and teach them about the Lord. They are our family now, and we do our best to make sure all their needs are met. But we cannot do it without help from loving people like you. <br> <br>

                  Job 29:11-12 <br>
                  
                  When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. <br> <br>
